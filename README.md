# Databases and Advanced Data Techniques

In this individual project, we created our database from a CSV file using MySQL. We also made a simple dashboard to view its outputs. 

Our CSV file contains public housing data in Singapore, sourced from https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d8b84c4ee58e3cfc0ece0d773c8ca6abc/view. We wanted to automate the process of converting our dataset into a database hence, we used Python to automate the writing of every single INSERT statement to insert each row of data into our MySQL database. After running the Python file, we get five .sql files that contain these SQL commands.

We then made a simple web application using Node.js and Mustache to display the results of our various queries to the database.

This was made in a Coursera Lab environment, and can be accessed in this link: https://hub.labs.coursera.org:443/connect/sharedalsqcxmb?forceRefresh=false&path=%2F%3Ffolder%3D%2Fhome%2Fcoder%2Fproject&isLabVersioning=true. 

Please use the environment in the link above to access the web application.
